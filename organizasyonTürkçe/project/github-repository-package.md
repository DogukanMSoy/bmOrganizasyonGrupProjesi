### 7. GitHub Workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml)

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
        pip install pytest
        
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest
```

## Repository Settings

After creating your repository, make sure to set up the following:

1. Enable branch protection for your main branch
2. Set up Dependabot alerts
3. Enable code scanning if applicable
4. Configure issue templates
5. Set up project boards for task tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Use clear repository names**: Choose descriptive names like "weather-forecast-api" instead of vague ones like "project1"
2. **Commit consistently**: Use consistent formatting for commit messages (imperative mood, keep first line under 50 chars)
3. **Keep dependencies out of version control**: Use package managers instead
4. **Archive unused repositories**: Make old repositories read-only
5. **Use issues and pull requests**: Track bugs and features formally
6. **Document everything**: Keep documentation up-to-date
7. **Enable security features**: Use GitHub's security tools

## Next Steps

1. Clone your repository locally
2. Add your code to the src directory
3. Write tests for your code
4. Update documentation
5. Push your changes
6. Set up continuous integration

Happy coding!
